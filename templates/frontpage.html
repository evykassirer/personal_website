			<p>
				I'm a self-motivated and dedicated software engineer, driven by curiosity and passion.
				<br><br>
				I study Computer Science at the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a> and am always excited about learning new technology and solving challenging problems. 
				I love working on projects that directly help people, and my career goal is to develop software to improve people's learning experiences.
				<br><br>
				I've worked with children and tutored students of various ages for over five years, and want to help improve the education system and society's attitude towards learning so that the intelligence and curiosity I've seen can be fostered.
				<br><br>
				I look forward to learning a variety of new things as I develop as a programmer, and am open to a variety of fields.
				<br><br>
				I am also a member of Waterloo's <a href="https://wics.uwaterloo.ca" tartet="_blank">Women in Computer Science</a> committee and have a passion for music which has led me to participate in a variety of ensembles over the years. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/newsong226/videos"  target="_blank">I sing and play ukulele</a>, viola, and piano.
