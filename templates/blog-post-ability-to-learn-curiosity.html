Have you asked yourself:

<blockquote>
	How do I get the most out of school?
	</br>
	How do I get a good co-op job / internship?
	</br>
	How do I achieve greatly (on projects, school courses, etc)?
	</br>
	How can I be more happy with who I am and what I'm doing?
</blockquote>


<p>
	There's one common theme in what I think is really effective for being satisfied and finding success, especially in technical fields like CS : the ability to learn - specifically, being curious and asking questions. Being able to learn things (not only what, but how and why) has been super useful not only during my time so far at Waterloo and Google, but for life in general. I want to talk about why being actively curious and asking questions is awesome, and the kinds of awesome things I am excited to learn about every day .
</p>


<h3>Asking Questions</h3>

I did these surveys on professional skills in the workplace/school (for the infamous PD2 report at Waterloo) and this was one anonymous response to my survey:

<blockquote>HEY YOU'RE THE CHICK WHO'S ALWAYS LATE TO ROBERT ANDRE'S MATH136 AND AWKWARDLY PULLS OUT THE CHAIR IN FRONT OF THE CLASS AND ASKS A SHIT LOAD OF QUESTIONS H4H4H4H4H4</blockquote>

<p>
	So yeah. This is actually pretty accurate.<em> (disclaimer: I had a class directly before that was fairly far away and ran between them some days but was usually just on time or about 1 minute late)</em> But in general, I've found that asking questions to myself, to other people, and to the internet is the easiest and most enjoyable way to learn. I learn a lot from my classes and happening upon articles on the internet. However, when I ask questions about what I'm legitimately curious about, I almost always learn things that are more interesting and relevant to me than what I learn passively. This means that I'm more likely to remember this information, and more likely to use it. The thing I hope you take away is this: Wonder about things. Questioning about what you want to find out will make the answers you find ( and the learning you do) all the more meaningful.
<p>

<h3>What I Get Excited to Learn About:</h3>
<h4>Learning About People</h4>
<p>
	I'm the kind of person that if you ask me "Hi, how are you?" or "what's up" I'll probably give you a fairly detailed answer, because I really enjoy meaningful conversation. One of my favourite questions to ask people I've recently met is "what's your passion" - the answers are not always something I expect, and people almost always have a lot of really interesting things to say about what they're passionate about. In fact, one of the best ways to learn about something is to talk to people who are truly passionate about that subject - they'll know the coolest parts and the craziest facts. I find that, in a conversation, asking questions is a very natural way to learn about someone. And not just the generic kind (how was your day, what's your major?) - try adding some followup (... why did you choose that as your major? Do you enjoy it?). Even just asking simple questions like "why" and "explain more about that" can lead to getting to know some interesting things about someone and what they do. I think that learning about other people is awesome for many reasons:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>It helps develop people skills - meeting people, becoming closer with friends, keeping healthy and happy friendships/relationships. When encountering tricky social situations, knowing more about other people makes it easier to figure out the best course of action.</li>
	<li>It helps you learn more about yourself . Just like how taking courses outside your major can help you understand what you're studying in a different way, or how learning a new musical instrument helps you play current instruments better, learning about other people can give you a broader and deeper understanding of human experience and context for your own experiences.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Learning How To Succeed</h4>
<p>
	But actually! So much of what I've accomplished has been from reading about how other people accomplish things and choosing my favourite strategies. Going into university? Ask people what helped them do best in their classes, and how they handled the work/play balance. Applying for jobs? Talk to people who have had success in the job hunt and get advice on resumes, cover letters, and interviews. Just a few weeks ago I talked over lunch with a woman at my workplace about what she looks for when she conducts interviews (if you're curious, her main point was don't pretend you know stuff when you don't). If you want to do something well - talking to someone that did it well can help enormously. Ask lots of questions. If you can't think of anything specific, something like "what advice would you give someone in first year to eventually get a job in your field" or "what is one thing you wished you knew when you were an intern" works fine, too. Many awesome experienced people love helping others and sharing their knowledge - you just need to ask questions. This is helpful because:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Collecting advice helps to build an idea of what the path to where you want to be could look like. There probably isn't one particular path or a numbered list of things to do, but there are certain things that people say that will keep popping up or will make sense/sound fun to you. This can help you decide what to try next, or what you want to keep in mind for the future.</li>
	<li>There are books and articles about success, but when it comes down to it, talking to someone directly and asking questions specific to your needs is probably the most efficient path to the best advice. Some of the things you hear aren't written in a book somewhere, but might make a huge difference in your life.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Learning at School / Work</h4>
<p>
	In my lectures when I'm taking notes, I try to make sure that I understand both what's happening on the board and often also how one would come up with the idea to try that technique (in the case of examples). Sometimes if I can, I try to guess what the prof is going to write before they even write it. I want to make sure I understand the math behind what was written before I write it down (instead of just going along with it and  passively following the steps). This is why I asked so many questions in my algebra class (heh). It's interesting that although we learn at school, we don't really learn <em>how to learn</em> (especially in high school). The key to really understanding something is to ask lots of questions about it - silently in your head before you get the answer, or out loud (on Piazza/Facebook). If you are more of a quiet wonderer, but feel you have an important question that was never answered, definitely speak up! This becomes even more important in the workplace (which my PD2 report discusses). You need to be curious and willing to ask questions because it is much less clear what you are supposed to do and how to do it than when you're in school  - even if the project is well laid out! Ask for feedback on your skills and progress, ask how to accomplish certain tasks if you can't find the answer yourself, and seriously, don't be afraid of not knowing things because it happens hella-lot. Asking questions at school/work is important because:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Asking questions about things allows you to develop a much deeper understanding than simply absorbing information as it comes. By asking questions, you get a chance to think critically and get more involved in the learning process. You actually have to think of something relevant to what you're learning that you're not sure about - this is thinking ahead, connecting the dots, assessing how much you know.</li>
	<li>It's a good way to stay on track. A lot of the time when someone is explaining something to me one-on-one or answering my question, I repeat what I think they said in different words, or try to compare the concept to something else - their reaction gives me a good idea of if I actually get it. I ask my friends and myself about concepts as I study; I ask my employer about my progress and ideas as I'm working. Sometimes I'm wrong about something and this helps me catch it much faster.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Be That Little Kid</h3>
<p>
	You know those little kids that are always like "what is that?" "why is that over there?"  "what does that do?" Be that little kid. I love the way that children are so excited and curious about things. I personally feel that keeping that curiosity alive helps me be happy and excited about my life. I've learned countless things and built countless connections with people through asking and answering questions. Wonder about things! Maybe you can think of an interesting possible answer yourself. Maybe you'll Google it. And if you're surrounded by other curious folks - they probably wouldn't mind a cool discussion about why there are things that look like mini solar panels on top of the sinks in the bathroom, even though there is no sunlight.
</p>

<h3>Long Story Short,</h3>
<p> Be actively curious. Ask cool questions. Get cool answers. Learn. </p>
