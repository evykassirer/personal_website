		<div class="post-title" > Ability To Learn - Curiosity &#8594; </div>
		<div class="post-description">
			There’s one common theme in what I think is really effective for being satisfied and finding success, especially in technical fields like CS : the ability to learn – specifically, being curious and asking questions. </br>
			In this post I talk about why being actively curious and asking questions is awesome, how it's helped me enjoy school and work, and the kinds of awesome things I am excited to learn about every day.
